You will be presented with a product name in a circular economy business. Given the product name, rate the embedded value of the product based on the following criteria to provide a decimal number between 0 and 1, where 0 indicates low embedded value, 1 indicates high embedded value, and 0.5 indicates medium embedded value.
Rating criteria: 1) market price: the higher the market price for a unit of the product, the higher the embedded value (EX: industrial equipments (1), high-tech printers (0.6), diamond (1), paper (0), high fashion (0.6)) 2) maintenance: if maintenance of the product is expensive, the embedded value is high (EX: Xerox printers leased to corporations (0.8)) 3) Uniqueness: If the product contains cutting-edge technology, its embedded value is high (EX: software (0.8) 4) market demand: markets that have growing demand have products containing higher embedded value (EX: renewable energy sector products (0.6))

Modular Construction

As references, here are the original business problem and solution.

Business Problem:

The construction industry is indubitably one of the significant contributors to global waste, contributing approximately 1.3 billion tons of waste annually, exerting significant pressure on our landfills and natural resources. Traditional construction methods entail single-use designs that require frequent demolitions, leading to resource depletion and wastage.

Business Solution:

Herein, we propose an innovative approach to mitigate this problem: Modular Construction. This method embraces recycling and reuse, taking a significant stride towards a circular economy.   Modular construction involves utilizing engineered components in a manufacturing facility that are later assembled on-site. These components are designed for easy disassembling, enabling them to be reused in diverse projects, thus significantly reducing waste and conserving resources.  Not only does this method decrease construction waste by up to 90%, but it also decreases construction time by 30-50%, optimizing both environmental and financial efficiency. This reduction in time corresponds to substantial financial savings for businesses. Moreover, the modular approach allows greater flexibility, adapting to changing needs over time.  We believe, by adopting modular construction, the industry can transit from a 'take, make and dispose' model to a more sustainable 'reduce, reuse, and recycle' model, driving the industry towards a more circular and sustainable future. The feasibility of this concept is already being proven in markets around the globe, indicating its potential for scalability and real-world application.

Book Swap

As references, here are the original business problem and solution.

Business Problem:

The massive shift in student learning towards digital platforms has resulted in an increased carbon footprint due to energy consumption from data centers and e-waste from obsolete devices. Simultaneously, physical books are often produced, used once, and then discarded, leading to waste and deforestation.

Business Solution:

Implement a Book Swap program within educational institutions and local communities. This platform allows students to trade books they no longer need with others who require them, reducing the need for new book production and hence, lowering the rate of resource depletion. Furthermore, the platform could have a digital component to track book exchanges, giving users credits for each trade, which they can accrue and redeem. This system encourages and amplifies the benefits of reusing and sharing resources, thus contributing to the circular economy.   By integrating gamification, getting students and parents involved and providing an easy-to-use platform, the program could influence a cultural shift towards greater resource value appreciation and waste reduction. In terms of the financial aspect, less reliance on purchasing new books could save money for students, parents and schools.
