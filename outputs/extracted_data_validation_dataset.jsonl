The solution lies in harnessing the potential of insects, specifically Black Soldier Flies (BSF), to convert organic waste into a valuable and sustainable alternative protein source for aquaculture and livestock.\r\n \r\n Currently, the food production system is facing numerous challenges. The overexploitation of ocean wildlife, driven by the demand for fishmeal in aquaculture, is depleting marine ecosystems. Furthermore, the expansion of soy farms to meet the growing demand for animal feed has resulted in significant deforestation, particularly in the Amazon rainforest. These practices contribute to the release of greenhouse gases, exacerbating climate change and harming the planet's environment.\r\n \r\n The company's innovative technology offers a solution to these challenges. By utilizing BSF as a natural bioconverter, organic food waste, including biowaste, can be transformed into high-value proteins and oils. The BSF larvae efficiently convert organic matter into insect biomass within a short period, making the process highly productive.\r\n \r\n The resulting insect biomass is then processed into various products, including whole-dried larvae, defatted protein meal, insect oil, and BSF eggs. These products serve as sustainable and nutritious alternatives to traditional protein sources, such as fishmeal and soymeal, in animal feed formulations.\r\n \r\n Additionally, the frass (insect excrement) generated during the BSF rearing process is repurposed into an organic insect fertilizer.

By utilizing the solar water disinfection (SODIS) method, the company's purification bag offers a simple and effective way to purify water using sunlight.\r\n \r\n The SODIS method harnesses the power of the sun's UVA and UVB rays to kill harmful bacteria and other microorganisms present in water. The purification bag is made of a multi-layered plastic composition that allows the sun's rays to penetrate and reach the water inside. The bag's design ensures that the water is exposed to sunlight for an adequate amount of time, typically around 4 hours, to achieve effective disinfection.\r\n \r\n The company's SaWa Can, an improved version of the widely used Jerry Can water storage solution, provides a larger water storage capacity of 6 liters and a longer lifespan due to its sturdy design. It is also locally manufactured, reducing carbon emissions in the supply chain. The SaWa Can's unique features, such as the handle for hanging and the tap for easy dispensing, minimize the risk of misuse and recontamination.\r\n \r\n The SaWa Can's purification technology aligns with the SODIS process endorsed by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a safe method for water purification. It combines UVA and UVB rays with heat from the sun to effectively kill organic pathogens present in water. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) formed by UVA play a crucial role in inactivating microorganisms, while UVB directly damages their DNA and RNA. The heat initiates a pasteurization process that accelerates the overall disinfection process.\r\n \r\n To use the SaWa Can effectively, users must lay it in direct sunlight for at least 4 hours. The purification process may need to be restarted if it rains or if heavy clouds appear. After purification, the SaWa Can should be stored indoors, and the purified water should be used within three days. Regular cleaning of the SaWa Can is recommended, using only water and avoiding soap or detergents. If the plastic changes color or breaks, users are advised to stop using the SaWa Can and seek assistance from a local agent.\r\n \r\n In summary, the company's solution addresses the problem of providing safe and affordable drinking water by utilizing the SODIS method in its purification bag and SaWa Can product.
