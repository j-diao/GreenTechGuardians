```

Given descriptions of a business problem in the circular economy and a corresponding business solution, extract the main product of the business solution. Do not output anything else.

Business Problem:

The construction industry is indubitably one of the significant contributors to global waste, contributing approximately 1.3 billion tons of waste annually, exerting significant pressure on our landfills and natural resources. Traditional construction methods entail single-use designs that require frequent demolitions, leading to resource depletion and wastage.

Business Solution:

Herein, we propose an innovative approach to mitigate this problem: Modular Construction. This method embraces recycling and reuse, taking a significant stride towards a circular economy.   Modular construction involves utilizing engineered components in a manufacturing facility that are later assembled on-site. These components are designed for easy disassembling, enabling them to be reused in diverse projects, thus significantly reducing waste and conserving resources.  Not only does this method decrease construction waste by up to 90%, but it also decreases construction time by 30-50%, optimizing both environmental and financial efficiency. This reduction in time corresponds to substantial financial savings for businesses. Moreover, the modular approach allows greater flexibility, adapting to changing needs over time.  We believe, by adopting modular construction, the industry can transit from a 'take, make and dispose' model to a more sustainable 'reduce, reuse, and recycle' model, driving the industry towards a more circular and sustainable future. The feasibility of this concept is already being proven in markets around the globe, indicating its potential for scalability and real-world application.

You will be presented with a product name, business problem, and business solution for a business idea in the circular economy.
Based on the following evaluation criteria, assess how difficult it is to gain access to the product.
Use a scale between 0 to 1 to rate the difficulty, where closer to 0 (easy) implies a simpler retrieval process and closer to 1 (hard) implies a more complex and difficult retrieval process.
Evaluation criteria:
1) Public participation: it is easier to retrieve a product if the public is enthusiastic to return or provide such product
(EX: if the product is water bottle recycling in Norway, and if Norwegian citizens are more willing to recycle water bottles, then the score will lean closer to 0)
2) Infrastructure and accessibility: Straightforward and streamlined retrieval processes makes is easier to access the product
(EX: recycling bins (easy, closer to 0), washing machines (hard, closer to 1), industrial equipment requiring infrastructural partnerships to retrieve (hard, closer to 1), products located in remote or difficult-to-reach areas (hard, closer to 1), wind turbines (hard, closer to 1), products requiring specialized equipment or expertise to retrieve (hard, closer to 1)) 3) Existence of secondary markets: products containing materials with higher resale value are harder to access (EX: construction equipment (hard, closer to 1), carpets (easy, closer to 0)).
